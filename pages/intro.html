                We are a group of volunteers working on supporting the Mozilla Project in any ways we can. There are already many contributors working individually by developing for Mozilla from Nepal too. But, there are even more capable and interested people here. Our main focus is to gather such people and show them proper path to accomplish their targets. And our other objective is to contribute to Mozilla Project as a team, as Mozilla Nepal, instead of individual contributions. Also, we strongly support FOSS!!
                For now, we are thinking to work under FOSS Nepal, and later when we gain a good momentum, we will work separately (of course not as a competitor to any community out there). This is a our current plan. But we can start working by ourselves too, depending on the feedbacks from the members. 
                Who can join Mozilla Nepal?<br />
                Anyone. Just show that you are interested to dedicate some of your time, even if it is just for 5 minutes. As you already know, this is a volunteer only group, so we do not force you to join the group. Or, even after you join the group, we do not force you to work compulsorily. Just work with your interest whenever you feel like it.
                <br /><br />
                What are the advantages of contributing for Mozilla Project?
